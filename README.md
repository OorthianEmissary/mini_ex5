- It's the first 20 or so episode quotes.

I used the RiMarkov function to sort through my text and the p5.speech library to make text-to-speech.
I found it much harder to work with text, than with simple shapes. It quickly becomes very technical, I have had to look up way more things than last time. Fun Fact: p5.js isn't able to use all .ttf (aka. font files), as it's kern table doesn't support weird .ttf's. A kern table is something that looks at text, look it up on wiki. I never thought I'd have to know that, but I wouldn't have made it withoutthat piece of knowledge. Farewell Megrim.ttf, you're beautiful, don't feel bullied by that Kern Table.

My program explores the materiality of text in a way books aren't able to do. The two elements that differ the programs from normal books are: reading aloud, and random generation.
My program randomly selects one of the lines in the textfile and reads it aloud. The is of course possible with a book, opening random pages and reading them aloud, but the book itself doesn't include speech nor randomness, rather it is an inherent property of the reader. On the other hand, this program includes both of those things and thus doesn't require more than a user being able to click the mouse. Futhermore, the user could become absolete with few modifications to the code. If this was a book, with the few modifications, the book wouldn't need a reader, it could do its function on its own.
